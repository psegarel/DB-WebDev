This module makes possible to repeat a mass invite in order to rember the invitee that he / she is invited.

After enabling an extra tab is showed under the Tab 'Track Invitations'. 

Under this tab all invites shown that are at least 2 days old but not older than 90 days on a pagered layout of max 100 invites. The invites shown also are not canceled and not accepted. 

On this page you can select the invites (or all the invites) that you want to resent. The resent invite uses the same registration code als the original invite, so the invitee can still use the orinal invite to prevent confusion. 
After selection, you have to give the invite text in the same way as the module Invite does. 

Resent invites are stored in the table 'invites'. The orginal invite is updated with a number add te the registration_code and with the column 'canceled' set to 1.
