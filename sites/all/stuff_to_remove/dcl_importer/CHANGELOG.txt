DCL Importer 6.x-2.x-dev - Aug 20, 2009
------------------------------------
 * Major reworking of the import_action hook to make it simpler and more effective
 * The invite flow has changed dramatically and instead of being redirected to the
   invite page you simply add your message on the invite page itself.
 * The gridselect module is now needed to properly display the existing contacts
   (i.e. "Friends on this site")
 * There is now an "advanced" form that can be used. This is still experimental and
   needs the ahah_helper and gridselect module to work
 * #551030: Added more requirements checking to the openinviter engine to ensure
   that the user has the proper modules and libraries installed
 * #539412: The select-all functionality has been moved into the global admin area
   and done more cleanly with javascript (select-all will now fail without javascript).
 * user_relationships support is currently broken.
